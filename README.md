# **Number Classification using a Simple Neural Network (ANN)**

## **Project Description**  
This project demonstrates the use of a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), widely used in machine learning and computer vision tasks. The goal is to train a neural network to accurately classify these digits based on pixel values.

This implementation uses **Keras** and **TensorFlow** to create and train the neural network. The project provides a step-by-step guide to data preprocessing, neural network design, training, and evaluation.

## **Features**

### **Data Preprocessing**  
- **Loading the Dataset**: The MNIST dataset is loaded from Keras's built-in dataset library.  
- **Normalization**: Input images are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 for better performance during training.  
- **Reshaping**: Data is reshaped to fit the neural network input layer.

### **Neural Network Architecture**  
- **Input Layer**: 784 neurons (one for each pixel in the 28x28 images).  
- **Hidden Layer**: 128 neurons with ReLU activation function.  
- **Output Layer**: 10 neurons (one for each digit, with softmax activation for classification).  

### **Training**  
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy, as it's a multi-class classification problem.  
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient gradient descent.  
- **Accuracy Metric**: Accuracy is used to evaluate model performance.

### **Model Evaluation**  
- The trained model is evaluated using a test set that was not seen during training. The accuracy is displayed, showing how well the model performs on unseen data.

### **Visualizations**  
- **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize classification performance.  
- **Training & Validation Curves**: To observe loss and accuracy over epochs.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:  
  - **TensorFlow** & **Keras**: For building and training the neural network.  
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.  
  - **Matplotlib**: For plotting training history and visualizing the confusion matrix.
